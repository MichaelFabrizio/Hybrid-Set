# Hybrid-Set
Inspired by the Sparse Set data structure which is commonly used for Entity Component Systems (ECS). 

The Hybrid Set can represent data with higher cache locality, and in the best cases it is perfectly contiguous. This is at the expense of slightly slower lookup/add/remove times, which are still O(Constant) time complexity.

More details to come.
